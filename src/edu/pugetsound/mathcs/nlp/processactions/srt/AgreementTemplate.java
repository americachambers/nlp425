 * @author Thomas Gagne & Jon Sims

 * A template for constructing a response which agrees with what the user said.
 * This differs from AcceptTemplate in that this class is explicit about whether it agrees or not,
 * whereas AcceptTemplate is more implicit.
 * Example responses include "I agree with that."
