/**
 * @author Thomas Gagne & Jon Sims
 * @version 04/26/16
 * A template for constructing a response which instructs the user to do something.
 * Almost every single time this appeared in the corpus, it was used to tell the user to
 * "Go ahead", as in to start speaking. Currently, this is all this template does, but it might
 * become more advanced.
